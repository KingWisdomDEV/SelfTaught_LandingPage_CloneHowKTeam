This project is SelfTaugh landing page for selling online courses.
I watched all the videos and redesigned the product in my own style on the HowKteam's course.

Prepare:
  1. Install NPM (Node Package Manager)
  2. Install SASS with NPM by running: npm install -g sass
  3. Complie .scss or .sass to .css files. 
    For example:
      sass ./sass/main.scss ./css/style.css
    or using --watch to auto compile when anything changes in sass files
      sass ./sass/main.scss ./css/style.css --watch

Techniques:
  1. HTML5
  2. CSS3
  3. SASS(CSS pre-processor)

Design Pattern:
  1. Using 7-1 Parttern Architecture to setup sass folder
  2. Using BEM (Block. Element. Modifier) for naming class
